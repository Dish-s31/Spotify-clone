JAvascript logic 

1. first we created an audioelement object from Audio(), constructor , which gives us an HTMLaudioElement object.
2. in that object i.e. audioElement in our code, we can use methods and functions like audioElement.play() => which will play the song for us.
3. Other methods are also there like currentTime,duration,paused,muted,volume.
4. HTMLaudioElement is based on its parent HTMLmediaElement interface and inherets its properties and methods from there and its ancestor HTmlElement, it doesn't have any its own properties. 
5. The classList property is read-only, but you can use the methods listed below, to add, toggle or remove CSS classes from the list:
6. The classList property returns the CSS classnames of an element.

7. The classList property returns a DOMTokenList.
